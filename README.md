Hi, everyone!
Within this repository, you'll find two HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that I wrote. 
index.html serves as the main website, while blog.html displays my personal blog, where I share some of my professional accolades and favorite life events.
I focused on organization, consistency, and uniqueness, drawing inspiration from my favorite websites, my colleagues' websites, and AI.
Additionally, the images folder contains all the images and external files used throughout the website.
I hope you all enjoy my creation!
