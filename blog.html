            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">With Every No, Comes a Yes?</h3>
            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on March 16, 2025</small>
            <p>I've learned that with every no, a yes follows. But when is my yes?

                I've been on the job hunt for about three months now, and nothing seems to be sticking. I tailor my resume, craft thoughtful cover letters, and still—silence. No interviews, no callbacks. Just automated rejection emails or, worse, nothing at all.
                
                I’m in my 20s, juggling three part-time jobs, yet I still feel unemployed. Working at a coffee shop wasn’t the "big girl" job I imagined for myself. I know I’m a good candidate, but if that’s true, why am I not even getting a chance to prove it?
                
                Maybe I need to change something—my approach, my expectations, or even my mindset. Should I start networking more? Rethink my applications? I don’t know the answer yet, but I do know one thing: my #yes is out there. I just have to find it.</p>

        <div class="post" data-tags="Personal, Social Media">
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">What Makes a Candidate Stand Out?</h3>
            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on March 14, 2025</small>
            <p>I’ve been conducting interviews for my social media job on campus, and it’s been eye-opening. Seeing what makes a strong applicant—and what doesn’t—has given me a whole new perspective on the hiring process.

                What impresses me the most? Tailored resumes and cover letters that align with the job description. It’s clear when a candidate has put in the effort, and that attention to detail stands out. But beyond the documents, I love when an applicant's passion and enthusiasm come through, even over a screen.
                
                Interviewing in-person, however, tells a different story. I’ve learned that a candidate can be #perfect on paper but not necessarily the right fit for the role. Personality, confidence, and how someone carries themselves can make or break an interview.
                
                As someone also applying for jobs, this experience has made me reflect: How can I use these insights to refine my own job search? It’s one thing to look great on paper, but how do I ensure that my presence in an interview leaves just as strong of an impression?</p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Turning Pages Turned my Perspectives</h3>
            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on February 28, 2025</small>
            <p>I just finished I’m Glad My Mom Died by Jennette McCurdy. My first ever personal read, front-to-back. Not for school, not because I had to, but because I wanted to. Does that make me a #booklover now?

                I’ve never been much of a reader. I used to force my way through assigned books in school, skimming pages, hoping I’d absorb enough to get by. But after graduating college, I’ve had more time to sit with myself and ask: Who do I want to be? How do I want to be perceived?
                
                I want to be #thatgirl—the one sitting on a park bench in her worn-out jean jacket, lost in a book, fully present in her own world while the sun warms her skin. I want to be independent. Motivated. Smart. The kind of person who reads not just to pass time, but to learn something, to feel something.
                
                McCurdy’s book sat on my shelf for three years. Three years of collecting dust, waiting for me to finally pick her up. And when I did, I didn’t expect to feel this connected. The way she writes about trauma, control, and coming to terms with the parts of your past that have shaped you—it hit me harder than I thought it would.
                
                Reading can sometimes be viewed as just words on a page. But for me, finishing a chapter felt like a small victory. Like I was unlocking a version of myself I hadn’t met yet. And now, I want more.</p>

            <p>Even on rainy days, Disney still holds it's title as the "Happiest Place on Earth"! 25,000 steps and 19 rides later, I enjoyed the day hanging out with 2/3 of my old college roomies. So blessed to have made such close friendships. #lovethem</p>

            <p>Started my first day as a supervisor at my social media job! I'm excited and nervous. Excited for the opportunity to prove my leadership skills, and nervous because I'll be given a lot more responsibility. Wish me luck! #promoted</p>

            <p>You mean, I don't have to submit homework to professors anymore? That's crazy. At 4:17 p.m. on 12/5/24, I submitted my #LAST ever project. Felt a little uneventful since all I did was download, upload, then submit for my last assignment, but I'm done! So proud and happy with all I've learned and how much I've grown in college, and ALL the oter schooling prior. #covidgraduate #hiremeplease</p>

            <p>Fun, yet stressful day! Met four complete strangers and managed to earn Best Storytelling in today's Data Competition. Python and Tableau continue to amaze me with its ability to manipulate and transform a disorganized dataset into something amazing. I learned from a 5,000 row dataset that Tuesdays are actually the cheapest and least busy day to fly. #themoreyouknow</p>

            <p>A year ago today, I had no clue what GIS was and now I'm celebrating it! Happy GIS Day! I celebrated by attending and submitting a project to the GIS Day Story Maps Competition. I heard from panelist, professors, and the Major of Pomona! I also had the opportunity to present and compete in the Story Maps Competition. My team earned second place on our analysis of Introducing Premium Grocery Stores to Orange County, CA. #GISday</p>

            <p>Definitely went out of my comfort zone today! I had the opportunity to host the very #first episode of "Bronco Banter" where I interviewed the ASI President, ASI VP, and some students about finals szn & the ASI Action Plan. I learned so much about student government and what they do directly for students. Check out the results of the interview on Instagram @ASICPP</p>

            <p>Got to witness the 'Best Day Ever' for the most impressive 9-year-old I know. Allergic Emma was announced as the 21st Duck at the Anaheim Duck's season home opener. Emma skated on the ice of the Honda Center with the team in front of 17,000+ people while representing the 220 million people worldwide with food allergies. Lucky to be on Team Allergic Emma and that I was there to witness and cheer her on from Section 417. #AllergicEmma</p>
