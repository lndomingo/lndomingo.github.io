            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">National Coffee Day Update ‚òï</h3>
            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on September 29, 2025</small>
            <p>Happy National Coffee Day! Working as a #barista has been such a fun journey so far. Today, my manager mentioned that I‚Äôm really good at talking to people, and honestly, that made my day. I‚Äôve realized that I thrive on reinforcement and little comments like that‚Äîit puts me in such a good mood. I genuinely love talking to customers, sharing laughs, and knowing that something as simple as my energy or a compliment can make someone‚Äôs day brighter.</p>
            <p>What‚Äôs wild is that I started this job knowing absolutely nothing (about coffee). I couldn‚Äôt even tell you the difference between a #latte and an #americano. Now, I‚Äôm the one explaining it to others! That growth feels so rewarding. I love seeing progress in myself, both in skills and in confidence. This job is more than just making coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs about connecting with people, and that‚Äôs what I enjoy most. ‚òï‚ú®</p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Six Months Into My Yoga Journey</h3>
            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on September 21, 2025</small>
            <p>
                Six months ago, I started yoga with my friend Michelle. We tried Pilates first, but it was just too expensive, so we decided to give CorePower Yoga a shot during their free week. The first class? Way too hot, way too crowded‚ÄîI thought it wasn‚Äôt for me. But somehow, I went back, and the second class completely changed how I felt about yoga.<br><br>
                
                Since then, I‚Äôve tried so many classes: Yoga Sculpt, CorePower 2, CoreRestore, HPF, and C1.5. Each one teaches me to be aware of every part of my body‚Äîfrom stretching tight muscles to engaging my core. On top of that, the instructors often share little life lessons that stick with me long after class, helping me approach challenges and stress differently. It‚Äôs amazing how something on the mat can shape your mindset off it too.<br><br>
                
                One of my favorite things about my membership? I can bring friends as ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù for free. Having them in class makes everything more fun, and honestly, it keeps me motivated on days I might otherwise skip. I go four times a week now, and I‚Äôm seeing real change‚Äînot just in my body (I feel stronger and more flexible), but in my mental health too. I‚Äôm calmer, more focused, and better at handling stress.<br><br>
                
                And guess what? I‚Äôm just 20 classes away from hitting 100 classes! I can‚Äôt believe how far I‚Äôve come in just six months. Yoga has become my reset button, my space to recharge, and a reminder to slow down and be present. I‚Äôm so grateful for this journey, and I can‚Äôt wait to see where the next 100 classes take me. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú® #YogaJourney #Wellness #MindBodyBalance #StressRelief

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Two Weeks on the Road: My Summer Cross-Country Adventure</h3>
            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on August 13, 2025</small>
            <p>
                This summer, I took a two-week roadtrip that spanned ten states, countless hours in the car, and more core memories than I can count. From spotting celebrities mid-flight to music festivals, family time, waterfalls, and birthday celebrations‚Äîthis trip had everything. #Summer2025 #TravelDiaries<br><br>
        
                <i>Monday, July 28</i> ‚Äî Flight day! I boarded UA 1505 out of Orange County, bound for Denver, and landed mid-morning. Fun surprise: Jeffree Star was on my plane. (Yes, <i>that</i> Jeffree Star‚Äîpink hair and all.) Andrea scooped me up at the airport, and we immediately kicked off the trip with a 10-hour drive through Colorado and Kansas into Missouri. Crossing from MDT into CDT felt like a little time travel trick. We finally pulled into our hotel, collapsed onto the beds, and ended the night with dinner with some Kansas City BBQ and a much-needed recharge. #KansasCity<br><br>

                <i>Tuesday, July 29</i> ‚Äî Back on the road bright and early, leaving Kansas City at 8:19am. Another 9 hours in the car meant snacks, playlists, and a lot of road signs. By 5pm, we pulled up to my family's house in Chicago. My aunt, uncle, and four cousins greeted us with hugs, dinner, and all the cozy family vibes. Nothing beats a warm welcome after a marathon commute. #FamilyTime<br><br>
                
                <i>Wednesday, July 30</i> ‚Äî A slower Chicago day to reset. Andrea and I walked to CorePower Yoga for a 9am Sculpt class (sweaty but worth it), then headed to Bryn Mawr for breakfast‚ÄîI had chicken and waffles that basically set the tone for the rest of the trip‚Äôs indulgences. That evening, we had Chinese food with family and cozied up watching <i>The Summer I Turned Pretty</i> with my cousins. #YogaAndChill<br><br>
                
                <i>Thursday, July 31</i> ‚Äî First day of #Lollapalooza! Downtown Chicago came alive with energy‚Äîcrowds swarming Grant Park, sponsor booths handing out free gifts, expensive drinks to set the tone, the skyline as our backdrop. I danced my heart out to ROLE MODEL, Gracie Abrams, Alex Warren, and Luke Combs. It was magical‚Äîthough my feet would disagree after a full day of standing in heels. Rookie mistake. #LollaDay1<br><br>
                
                <i>Friday, August 1</i> ‚Äî Chicago gave us a break from the chaos. While some of the Wong cousins went back to Lolla, Andrea and I explored the city. Brunch at Pizzeria Portofino along the river (giant cocktails = Instagram-worthy, wallet = less happy), wandering downtown, then reconnecting with Andrea‚Äôs friends midday and again late at night. City living at its finest. #ChicagoVibes<br><br>
                
                <i>Saturday, August 2</i> ‚Äî Family day meets music night. Andrea and I skipped Lolla and joined the Wong crew at the #Ravinia Festival in Highland Park. Imagine hundreds of picnic blankets, wine glasses clinking, and music floating over the speakers from the amphitheater. We caught Edwin McCain and Train‚Äî‚ÄúDrops of Jupiter‚Äù live under the stars was everything. #Ravinia<br><br>
                
                <i>Sunday, August 3</i> ‚Äî Back to Lollapalooza for a full send. The highlight? Watching Boy Next Door (a K-pop group featuring my cousin‚Äôs friend‚Äôs cousin‚Äîsmall world vibes) perform their Lolla debut, then running between sets for Mariah the Scientist, Dominic Fike, and finally Sabrina Carpenter. She headlined, brought out Earth, Wind & Fire, and lit up the night. #FestivalMagic<br><br>
                
                <i>Monday, August 4</i> ‚Äî A day packed with Chicago moments. We brunched with Andrea downtown, gathered for KBBQ with five cousins + Andrea, grabbed bougie coffee and matcha, and ended the night at Wrigley Field. My cousin works for the Cubs, so we got an insider peek before catching the 7:05pm game against the Reds. Baseball under the lights = summer classic. #GoCubs<br><br>
                
                <i>Tuesday, August 5</i> ‚Äî Time to say goodbye to Chicago. We hit the road for another 9-hour drive, cutting through Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Lunch stop = Lucky Louie‚Äôs in Erie, PA, which had the craziest hotdog creations (definitely not diet-friendly). That evening, we made it to Buffalo and capped the night with a visit to Niagara Falls. Photos don‚Äôt do it justice‚Äîthe roar, the mist, the sheer scale‚Äîit‚Äôs humbling. #NiagaraFalls<br><br>
                
                <i>Wednesday, August 6</i> ‚Äî Another long drive, but worth it. We stopped in Williamstown, MA to finally see Provisions, the wine and cheese shop I work for remotely. Stocked up on snacks, grabbed bottles, and turned it into a mini charcuterie road stop. By evening, we were pulling into Andrea‚Äôs place in Vermont, ready for a slower pace. #WorkTrip<br><br>
                
                <i>Thursday, August 7</i> ‚Äî Vermont day. We played volleyball in the woods with Andrea‚Äôs boyfriend and friends, grabbed maple ice cream (when in Vermont, right?), and had dinner at a cozy restaurant in an old train station. With Elements Festival on deck, it was the perfect low-key pause. #SmallTownMagic<br><br>
                
                <i>Friday, August 8 ‚Äì Sunday, August 10</i> ‚Äî #Elements Festival weekend! We planned to leave at 9am but grad student life delayed us to 1pm (shoutout thesis deadlines). Still, we made it to Long Pond, PA, where the festival was set inside Pocono Raceway. Camping in tents, grilling hotdogs, and three straight days of EDM‚Äîsets from Illenium, Zeds Dead, and DJ Diesel (aka Shaq) shook the ground. Chaos, laughter, dancing until sunrise. #ElementsFestival<br><br>
                
                <i>Monday, August 11</i> ‚Äî Back to Vermont, a little dusty but happy. That night, on the eve of my birthday, we made a charcuterie board, opened some moscato, and just vibed. A simple, perfect celebration. #BirthdayEve<br><br>
                
                <i>Tuesday, August 12</i> ‚Äî Birthday send-off! Andrea treated me to lunch, then I left Hanover at 12:40pm on a coach bus to Boston, arriving by 3:40pm. A bittersweet goodbye, but the best way to close out two whirlwind weeks before flying home to LA. #BirthdayTravel<br><br>
                
                Looking back, this trip had it all: BBQ and baseball, waterfalls and festivals, yoga mornings and rooftop nights, wholesome family time and chaotic campgrounds. Every state brought a new memory, and every mile was worth it. Already counting down to the next adventure. ‚ú®

            <p>
                The 4th annual Allergic Emma event today was extra special this year! Emma, our incredible 9-year-old advocate, even received the President's Volunteer Service Award signed by Joe Biden‚Äîwhat an inspiring moment to witness. #AllergicEmma #FoodAllergyAwareness<br><br>
                I had the honor of leading the volunteers and guiding them to where they were needed most. This was exciting because, for the first time in our four events, we had outside volunteers helping us, which brought a whole new energy to the day. #Volunteering #Community<br><br>
                One of the coolest things I learned? Maggiano‚Äôs is completely nut-free‚Äîa total lifesaver for someone allergic to all nuts! From fun activities to learning life-saving tips, everyone left empowered and inspired. #MakingADifference üíõ

            <p>
                I had such a great time attending the AMA (American Marketing Association) event on campus! It was awesome to connect with fellow marketing enthusiasts and learn about the latest trends and strategies in the industry. #MarketingLife #AMA<br><br>
                From networking tips to real-world marketing examples, I walked away inspired and ready to apply what I learned in future projects. It‚Äôs amazing to see how much you can grow by attending events like these and connecting with people who share your passion. #CampusEvents #Networking<br><br>

            <p>Was so honored for the opportunity to represent Cal Poly Pomona's Computer Information Systems Bachelor's Department at today's Innovatioin Symposium!</p>
            <p>My professor reached out to invite my group to present one of our projects. It was the "Introducing Premium Grocery Stores to Orange County, CA" project. This project utilized Esri's ArcGIS tools to create a Story Map displaying our findings on what specific zipcode could best benefit with a new premium grocery store.</p> 
            <p>Besides presenting, the day was filled with panels, speakers, workshops, and networking with a prestigious group of alumni, business entrepreneurs, and CPP royalty. My biggest takeaway from this event was to not be afraid of failure. It was a good reminder and good motivation. I'm truly honored my professor reached out and thought of my group to represent the College of Business's CIS department.</p>

            <p>Growing up in sports, I was always asking, ‚ÄúHow can I improve?‚Äù That mindset has carried over to my work as a barista, where I‚Äôm always looking for ways to get better‚Äîwhether in customer service, speed, or product knowledge. I recently had my first annual performance review, and while it wasn‚Äôt perfect, it wasn‚Äôt bad either. 
                
                Working just 10 hours a week means I learn at a slower pace than those who work more often.</p> <p>My manager praised my positive attitude and willingness to learn, but also noted that I ask a lot of questions, which can sometimes make me seem less confident in my skills. I recognize that I need to work on being more independent and confident in my abilities. I appreciate this feedback, as it‚Äôs something I can improve on as a barista.</p> 
                
                <p>With more time and experience, I know I‚Äôll improve in speed and knowledge. I‚Äôm proud of the foundation I‚Äôve built and excited for what‚Äôs ahead. 
                
                The advice I received doesn‚Äôt just apply to my role as a barista, but to any part of life‚Äîalways striving to improve, be more independent, and gain confidence.</p>

            <p>Filming backstage at the Honda Center right before a professional hockey game? Definitely not your average day. 
                
                Allergic Emma was invited to film a TikTok to ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù by Destiny‚Äôs Child, and I got to direct, film, and edit the whole thing. The Anaheim Ducks‚Äô Power Player Girls choreographed the dance just for Emma and were incredibly welcoming. We filmed right by the entrance onto the ice, with bright lights shining on us and early fans watching through the clear glass.

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">With Every No, Comes a Yes?</h3>
            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on March 16, 2025</small>
            <p>I've learned that with every no, a yes follows. But when is my yes?

                I've been on the job hunt for about three months now, and nothing seems to be sticking. I tailor my resume, craft thoughtful cover letters, and still‚Äîsilence. No interviews, no callbacks. Just automated rejection emails or, worse, nothing at all.
                
                I‚Äôm in my 20s, juggling three part-time jobs, yet I still feel unemployed. Working at a coffee shop wasn‚Äôt the "big girl" job I imagined for myself. I know I‚Äôm a good candidate, but if that‚Äôs true, why am I not even getting a chance to prove it?
                
                Maybe I need to change something‚Äîmy approach, my expectations, or even my mindset. Should I start networking more? Rethink my applications? I don‚Äôt know the answer yet, but I do know one thing: my #yes is out there. I just have to find it.</p>
        </div>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">What Makes a Candidate Stand Out?</h3>
            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on March 14, 2025</small>
            <p>I‚Äôve been conducting interviews for my social media job on campus, and it‚Äôs been eye-opening. Seeing what makes a strong applicant‚Äîand what doesn‚Äôt‚Äîhas given me a whole new perspective on the hiring process.

                What impresses me the most? Tailored resumes and cover letters that align with the job description. It‚Äôs clear when a candidate has put in the effort, and that attention to detail stands out. But beyond the documents, I love when an applicant's passion and enthusiasm come through, even over a screen.
                
                Interviewing in-person, however, tells a different story. I‚Äôve learned that a candidate can be #perfect on paper but not necessarily the right fit for the role. Personality, confidence, and how someone carries themselves can make or break an interview.
                
                As someone also applying for jobs, this experience has made me reflect: How can I use these insights to refine my own job search? It‚Äôs one thing to look great on paper, but how do I ensure that my presence in an interview leaves just as strong of an impression?</p>

                I‚Äôve never been much of a reader. I used to force my way through assigned books in school, skimming pages, hoping I‚Äôd absorb enough to get by. But after graduating college, I‚Äôve had more time to sit with myself and ask: Who do I want to be? How do I want to be perceived?
                
                I want to be #thatgirl‚Äîthe one sitting on a park bench in her worn-out jean jacket, lost in a book, fully present in her own world while the sun warms her skin. I want to be independent. Motivated. Smart. The kind of person who reads not just to pass time, but to learn something, to feel something.
                
                McCurdy‚Äôs book sat on my shelf for three years. Three years of collecting dust, waiting for me to finally pick her up. And when I did, I didn‚Äôt expect to feel this connected. The way she writes about trauma, control, and coming to terms with the parts of your past that have shaped you‚Äîit hit me harder than I thought it would.
                
                Reading can sometimes be viewed as just words on a page. But for me, finishing a chapter felt like a small victory. Like I was unlocking a version of myself I hadn‚Äôt met yet. And now, I want more.</p>

            <p>Even on rainy days, Disney still holds it's title as the "Happiest Place on Earth"! 25,000 steps and 19 rides later, I enjoyed the day hanging out with 2/3 of my old college roomies. So blessed to have made such close friendships. #lovethem</p>

            <p>Started my first day as a supervisor at my social media job! I'm excited and nervous. Excited for the opportunity to prove my leadership skills, and nervous because I'll be given a lot more responsibility. Wish me luck! #promoted</p>

            <p>You mean, I don't have to submit homework to professors anymore? That's crazy. At 4:17 p.m. on 12/5/24, I submitted my #LAST ever project. Felt a little uneventful since all I did was download, upload, then submit for my last assignment, but I'm done! So proud and happy with all I've learned and how much I've grown in college, and ALL the oter schooling prior. #covidgraduate #hiremeplease</p>

            <p>Fun, yet stressful day! Met four complete strangers and managed to earn Best Storytelling in today's Data Competition. Python and Tableau continue to amaze me with its ability to manipulate and transform a disorganized dataset into something amazing. I learned from a 5,000 row dataset that Tuesdays are actually the cheapest and least busy day to fly. #themoreyouknow</p>

            <p>A year ago today, I had no clue what GIS was and now I'm celebrating it! Happy GIS Day! I celebrated by attending and submitting a project to the GIS Day Story Maps Competition. I heard from panelist, professors, and the Major of Pomona! I also had the opportunity to present and compete in the Story Maps Competition. My team earned second place on our analysis of Introducing Premium Grocery Stores to Orange County, CA. #GISday</p>

            <p>Definitely went out of my comfort zone today! I had the opportunity to host the very #first episode of "Bronco Banter" where I interviewed the ASI President, ASI VP, and some students about finals szn & the ASI Action Plan. I learned so much about student government and what they do directly for students. Check out the results of the interview on Instagram @ASICPP</p>

            <p>Got to witness the 'Best Day Ever' for the most impressive 9-year-old I know. Allergic Emma was announced as the 21st Duck at the Anaheim Duck's season home opener. Emma skated on the ice of the Honda Center with the team in front of 17,000+ people while representing the 220 million people worldwide with food allergies. Lucky to be on Team Allergic Emma and that I was there to witness and cheer her on from Section 417. #AllergicEmma</p>
