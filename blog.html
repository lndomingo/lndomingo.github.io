            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on May 10, 2025</small>
            <p>
                The 4th annual Allergic Emma event today was extra special this year! Emma, our incredible 9-year-old advocate, even received the President's Volunteer Service Award signed by Joe Biden‚Äîwhat an inspiring moment to witness. #AllergicEmma #FoodAllergyAwareness<br><br>
                I had the honor of leading the volunteers and guiding them to where they were needed most. This was exciting because, for the first time in our four events, we had outside volunteers helping us, which brought a whole new energy to the day. #Volunteering #Community<br><br>
                One of the coolest things I learned? Maggiano‚Äôs is completely nut-free‚Äîa total lifesaver for someone allergic to all nuts! From fun activities to learning life-saving tips, everyone left empowered and inspired. #MakingADifference üíõ

            <p>
                I had such a great time attending the AMA (American Marketing Association) event on campus! It was awesome to connect with fellow marketing enthusiasts and learn about the latest trends and strategies in the industry. #MarketingLife #AMA<br><br>
                From networking tips to real-world marketing examples, I walked away inspired and ready to apply what I learned in future projects. It‚Äôs amazing to see how much you can grow by attending events like these and connecting with people who share your passion. #CampusEvents #Networking<br><br>
                Big shoutout to AMA for putting together such an insightful experience‚ÄîI can‚Äôt wait for the next event! #MarketingCommunity #LearningEveryDay

            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on April 25, 2025</small>
            <p>Was so honored for the opportunity to represent Cal Poly Pomona's Computer Information Systems Bachelor's Department at today's Innovatioin Symposium!</p>
            <p>My professor reached out to invite my group to present one of our projects. It was the "Introducing Premium Grocery Stores to Orange County, CA" project. This project utilized Esri's ArcGIS tools to create a Story Map displaying our findings on what specific zipcode could best benefit with a new premium grocery store.</p> 
            <p>Besides presenting, the day was filled with panels, speakers, workshops, and networking with a prestigious group of alumni, business entrepreneurs, and CPP royalty. My biggest takeaway from this event was to not be afraid of failure. It was a good reminder and good motivation. I'm truly honored my professor reached out and thought of my group to represent the College of Business's CIS department.</p>

            <p>After months of planning, the day I‚Äôve been counting down to is finally here ‚Äî 
                it‚Äôs #electionszn for #ASICPP! üó≥Ô∏è</p>
            
              <p>Our goal as a marketing team was 1,001 student votes and‚Ä¶ drumroll please‚Ä¶ 
                we hit 1,215!! üéâ As the lead strategist and main online voice behind this Student Government campaign, 
                I‚Äôm beyond honored that our hard work paid off.
                Through consistent meetings, strategic posting, and data-driven initiatives, we didn‚Äôt just reach our goal ‚Äî we crushed it.</p>
                More than the numbers, I‚Äôm incredibly proud of the team beside me and grateful for the trust placed in me

            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on March 30, 2025</small>
            <p>Growing up in sports, I was always asking, ‚ÄúHow can I improve?‚Äù That mindset has carried over to my work as a barista, where I‚Äôm always looking for ways to get better‚Äîwhether in customer service, speed, or product knowledge. I recently had my first annual performance review, and while it wasn‚Äôt perfect, it wasn‚Äôt bad either. 
                
                Working just 10 hours a week means I learn at a slower pace than those who work more often.</p> <p>My manager praised my positive attitude and willingness to learn, but also noted that I ask a lot of questions, which can sometimes make me seem less confident in my skills. I recognize that I need to work on being more independent and confident in my abilities. I appreciate this feedback, as it‚Äôs something I can improve on as a barista.</p> 
                
                <p>With more time and experience, I know I‚Äôll improve in speed and knowledge. I‚Äôm proud of the foundation I‚Äôve built and excited for what‚Äôs ahead. 
                
                The advice I received doesn‚Äôt just apply to my role as a barista, but to any part of life‚Äîalways striving to improve, be more independent, and gain confidence.</p>

            <p>Filming backstage at the Honda Center right before a professional hockey game? Definitely not your average day. 
                
                Allergic Emma was invited to film a TikTok to ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù by Destiny‚Äôs Child, and I got to direct, film, and edit the whole thing. The Anaheim Ducks‚Äô Power Player Girls choreographed the dance just for Emma and were incredibly welcoming. We filmed right by the entrance onto the ice, with bright lights shining on us and early fans watching through the clear glass. It felt like a moment straight out of a movie, with 9-year-old Emma as the main character.</p> 
                
                <p>My favorite part? Watching Emma absolutely glow with excitement. She was so ready to perform‚Äîand she crushed it.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">With Every No, Comes a Yes?</h3>
            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on March 16, 2025</small>
            <p>I've learned that with every no, a yes follows. But when is my yes?

                I've been on the job hunt for about three months now, and nothing seems to be sticking. I tailor my resume, craft thoughtful cover letters, and still‚Äîsilence. No interviews, no callbacks. Just automated rejection emails or, worse, nothing at all.
                
                I‚Äôm in my 20s, juggling three part-time jobs, yet I still feel unemployed. Working at a coffee shop wasn‚Äôt the "big girl" job I imagined for myself. I know I‚Äôm a good candidate, but if that‚Äôs true, why am I not even getting a chance to prove it?
                
                Maybe I need to change something‚Äîmy approach, my expectations, or even my mindset. Should I start networking more? Rethink my applications? I don‚Äôt know the answer yet, but I do know one thing: my #yes is out there. I just have to find it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="post" data-tags="Personal, Social Media">
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">What Makes a Candidate Stand Out?</h3>
            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on March 14, 2025</small>
            <p>I‚Äôve been conducting interviews for my social media job on campus, and it‚Äôs been eye-opening. Seeing what makes a strong applicant‚Äîand what doesn‚Äôt‚Äîhas given me a whole new perspective on the hiring process.

                What impresses me the most? Tailored resumes and cover letters that align with the job description. It‚Äôs clear when a candidate has put in the effort, and that attention to detail stands out. But beyond the documents, I love when an applicant's passion and enthusiasm come through, even over a screen.
                
                Interviewing in-person, however, tells a different story. I‚Äôve learned that a candidate can be #perfect on paper but not necessarily the right fit for the role. Personality, confidence, and how someone carries themselves can make or break an interview.
                
                As someone also applying for jobs, this experience has made me reflect: How can I use these insights to refine my own job search? It‚Äôs one thing to look great on paper, but how do I ensure that my presence in an interview leaves just as strong of an impression?</p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Turning Pages Turned my Perspectives</h3>
            <small style="display: block; margin-top: -2px; color: gray;">Posted on February 28, 2025</small>
            <p>I just finished I‚Äôm Glad My Mom Died by Jennette McCurdy. My first ever personal read, front-to-back. Not for school, not because I had to, but because I wanted to. Does that make me a #booklover now?

                I‚Äôve never been much of a reader. I used to force my way through assigned books in school, skimming pages, hoping I‚Äôd absorb enough to get by. But after graduating college, I‚Äôve had more time to sit with myself and ask: Who do I want to be? How do I want to be perceived?
                
                I want to be #thatgirl‚Äîthe one sitting on a park bench in her worn-out jean jacket, lost in a book, fully present in her own world while the sun warms her skin. I want to be independent. Motivated. Smart. The kind of person who reads not just to pass time, but to learn something, to feel something.
                
                McCurdy‚Äôs book sat on my shelf for three years. Three years of collecting dust, waiting for me to finally pick her up. And when I did, I didn‚Äôt expect to feel this connected. The way she writes about trauma, control, and coming to terms with the parts of your past that have shaped you‚Äîit hit me harder than I thought it would.
                
                Reading can sometimes be viewed as just words on a page. But for me, finishing a chapter felt like a small victory. Like I was unlocking a version of myself I hadn‚Äôt met yet. And now, I want more.</p>

            <p>Got to witness the 'Best Day Ever' for the most impressive 9-year-old I know. Allergic Emma was announced as the 21st Duck at the Anaheim Duck's season home opener. Emma skated on the ice of the Honda Center with the team in front of 17,000+ people while representing the 220 million people worldwide with food allergies. Lucky to be on Team Allergic Emma and that I was there to witness and cheer her on from Section 417. #AllergicEmma</p>
