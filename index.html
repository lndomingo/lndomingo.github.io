                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, welcome to my website! I'm Larissa, a Computer Information Systems and Marketing student at Cal Poly Pomona with a passion for data and marketing. 
                    I love the satisfaction of analyzing datasets, visualizing insights, and providing resourceful recommendations that can benefit others. 
                    My brain is constantly wired, wondering how companies utilize their data and how it could be leveraged to increase sales.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studying marketing has given me a unique perspective that most CIS students don't have. 
                    By constantly utilizing both my left and right brain, I blend creativity with logic, enabling me to come up with unique questions and spot trends. 
                    I am curious, organized, detail-oriented, and a team player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Away from the computer, I ironically LOVE being outside. 
                    I enjoy concerts, hiking, traveling, eating, and going on adventures! 
                    I live life with a "why not?" mindset, which leads me to some fun memories.
                </p>
